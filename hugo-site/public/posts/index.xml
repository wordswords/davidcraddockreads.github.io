      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPOILERS PRESENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni%27s_Room&#34;&gt;Giovanni&amp;rsquo;s Room by James Baldwin&lt;/a&gt; in preperation for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.waterstones.com/events/the-required-reading-book-club/manchester-deansgate-142155&#34;&gt;Waterstones Deansgate&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Required Reading&amp;rsquo; bookclub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0241718597&#34;&gt;Penguin Clothbound Classics version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was brilliant and affected me deeply. I did not know what it was really about before reading it, and I found the subject matter very difficult. I grew up in an area, time and had an upbringing that was very homophobic, and at least some of that homophobia has stayed with me - is ANY man who identifies as heterosexual entirely free from all social imprinting aspects of homophobia? I would hope that we are getting to an age where that is increasingly not the case, but in 2025 there are still entire countries where homosexuality is punishable by death.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Chekov and Frayn&#39;s Wild Honey</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although it is not a play, or even, a book, I wanted to write something about the BBC Radio 4&amp;rsquo;s 2018 audio version of &amp;lsquo;Wild Honey&amp;rsquo;, starring David Tennant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was broadcast in 2018, and is currently unvailable to stream, but the iPlayer (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b7pbdy%29[URL&#34;&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b7pbdy)[URL&lt;/a&gt; is here] if it becomes available again to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally got my own copy from &lt;a href=&#34;Archive.org&#34;&gt;Archive.org&lt;/a&gt; - I won&amp;rsquo;t provide the deep-link, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure you can search for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Books Blog</title>
      <link>https://davidcraddockreads.com/new-books-blog/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my new reading/books blog, where I will write reviews of books I&amp;rsquo;ve read, chart progress on books that I&amp;rsquo;m reading, and anything else literary-related that I can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is using the same setup as my main &lt;a href=&#34;https://davidcraddock.net&#34;&gt;https://davidcraddock.net&lt;/a&gt; blog - as in - it&amp;rsquo;s self-hosted, and uses the Hugo Go-based static blogging engine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
