title: Chekov and Frayn's Wild Honey

Although it is not a play, or even, a book, I wanted to write something about the BBC Radio 4's 2018 audio version of 'Wild Honey', starring David Tennant.

It was broadcast in 2018, and is currently unvailable to stream, but the iPlayer (https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b7pbdy)[URL is here] if it becomes available again to listen to.

I personally got my own copy from [Archive.org](Archive.org) - I won't provide the deep-link, but I'm sure you can search for it.

It is my first exposure to Chekov's plays, although I am a fan of his short stories, having listened to, and really enjoyed, Stephen Fry's reading before of some of Chekov's short stories.
