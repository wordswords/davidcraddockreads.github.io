I have been listening to [Edgar Allan Poe's Radio 4 readings in audiobook format](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59440943-edgar-allan-poe)

I find that his short stories are a really good length to listen to in noise-cancelling headphones when I am walking.

Honestly, I remember being much more scared when I read them as a child.

Which is good, because generally I don't like horror as I tend to have an over-active imagination.

So the short stories are just the right side of 'horror' for me - the weird alien side that I can reasonably listen to when walking down an alley on an overcast day and not panic. lol.

One of the benefits of having a full piracy-enabled home server is that I can download more or less any form of digital media and stream it from anywhere in the home or outside the home.

So, while I have free time as a student, and zero money, I am able to enjoy things like this.
